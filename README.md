Hi, I am Jiachen. I graduated with a Master of Science in Computational Neuroscience graduate from the University of Maryland, College Park, with a strong foundation in machine learning, reinforcement learning, data structures and computer algorithms. My academic journey also includes a Bachelor of Arts in Computational Neuroscience from Oberlin College, where I minored in Computer Science, Statistics, and Cognitive Sciences.
